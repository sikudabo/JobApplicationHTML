	<h1>Why I should work at OneStart and how my goals align with yours</h1>
	<p>Hello Mr. Allen. My name is Simeon Ikudabo and I highly respect what you do as the <em>Director of Engineering</em> at OneCause. I believe that you handle
	many tough responsibilities such as hiring hard-working individuals like me, evaluating if we can add value to the team, and giving us opportunities to succeed 		and bring value to OneCause. I believe that your experience, track record, and hard work <em>highlights</em> the kind of team that I want to become a member 			of and highlights the kind of team that I can add value to. I relate to you because <em>just like you</em> I want to deliver quality products to our clients and 	I want to show them that OneCause shares their fund raising goals, and will help them succeed. <em>Just like you</em> I attended an Indiana University campus, 			and learned many valuable things. I went to IU Bloomington, and you know that campuses such as IU and IUPUI prepare their students to be successful in the real 		world. You want individuals who had that kind of experience on your team because we don't learn classroom knowledge, we go beyond that and learn real-world 			knowledge. <em>Just like you</em> I have experience with SQL. 	
	I utilized my experience in it to develop an Emergency Room application that enables users to sign in to an 		emergency room from home, sign 				into a MySQL database, store their information in the hospitals system, chat with a doctor, and gain access to information that 			can ease 	the pain (and time) of going to an emergency room. As you know, many rural communitities in Indiana do not have this technology yet, and I have 				innovative ideas such as this one. Here is a sample <a href="https://github.com/sikudabo/Simeon-Ikudabo-Emergency-Room-Tracker" ref="external" title="myApp" />
	link</a> to my Application. I have posted parts of it to github. You will see that I am someone who is comfortable with the SQL syntax and I am comfortable with
	developing technology that people can use in the real world. <em>Just like you</em>I have experience in Java and I am learning more each and everyday about the 		language. Here is a sample math game that I created in Eclipse, but my knowledge of the language and applications that I am working on for <em>Android</em> go 			far beyond <a href='https://github.com/sikudabo/Math-proto' ref='external' title='my math game' /> this</a>. <em>Just like you</em> I have experience in HTML 		which is how I created <em>this</em> sample page. As you can see, I have many of the skills that your team requires, and I have the ability to add value to your 	team.</p>

	<h1>How my work ethic sets me apart and enables me to be successful</h1>
	<img = src='speeeed.jpg' height='200' width='200' />
	<p>During my time at Indiana University I was a member of the football team. Unlike most members of the team, I was a walk-on. I had to work extremely hard for 
	a spot on the team with no promises of playing time or a scholarship. I had to work as hard as I could to add value of the team, remain encouraged, and compete.
	I <em>thrive</em> in that kind of environment because I am naturally a hardworker who will outwork the competition. I am also a <em>team player</em>  who works 	well with other, and can motivate others to complete a common goal. My experience with working with a team, my experience of working hard without any handouts, 	and my experience of completing complex tasks will enable me to be successful at OneCause. What you will be gaining if you hire me is someone with the 	intagibles to be successful, and that could be a reward for you and the company in the future. You know that I have the work ethic, you know that I have 	completed projects on my own, and you know that adding me to the team can enable the team to be even more successful than it already is.

	<h1>How I can add value to the team now</h1>
	<p>I am ambitiously reaching out because I have a strong desire to join the OneCause team. I can add value to the team now because I will put in the work to 	learn, and to learn rapidly. My natural creativity, combined with my desire to learn vigorously are traits that will enable me to add value at OneCause. My 	empathy and ability to listen to others will enable me to contribute to the team, and contribute to our client's well-being. You see that I have the skills to 	learn, you see that I have the work-ethic, and you see that I will be a valued member of the team. Please give me an opportunity to join the OneCause software 	engineering team in some capacity. I believe that my work-ethic and desire are compatible with what OneCause is trying to achieve, and consistent with the 	companies goals. Thank you for your time.
